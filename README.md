# SpotiMuter - the legal Spotify "AdBlocker"
Ever been fed up with too much advertisements? Ever felt enraged after listening to the same ad every five minutes? Don't want to subscribe to one of their plans?
Well, I have a solution for you. It is called SpotiMuter.

# About
SpotiMuter is a simple console application written in C++. It mutes your device temporarily, and when the ad is over, it unmutes your PC.
The app can be used on any computer, by running the .exe that can be found in the repository.

# UI and future updates
In its current state the app lists the currently active program, and displays it on the standard output (dual monitor users in advantage).
In the future:
- Background app support
- dynamic volume setting
- and more
will be added.

Thanks for reading, have a good ad-free time!
